## 📋 **Certification Strategy**

### **Decision Matrix: AS9100 vs ISO 13485**

| Factor | AS9100 (Aerospace) | ISO 13485 (Medical) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Market Size** | Larger ($12B aerospace machining) | Medium ($8B medical device components) |
| **Pricing Premium** | 2–4× commercial rates | 2–3× commercial rates |
| **Lead Times** | Longer (12–26 weeks typical) | Medium (8–16 weeks typical) |
| **Complexity** | Very High (DFMEA, PFMEA, FAIR, config mgmt) | High (DHR, DMR, process validation) |
| **Audit Rigor** | Very High (annual surveillance + customer audits) | High (annual surveillance + FDA inspections if applicable) |
| **Material Traceability** | Extreme (mill certs, heat lot tracking) | High (lot tracking to patient level) |
| **Best Fit If...** | You have aerospace contacts or nearby OEMs | You have medical device contacts; cleanroom optional |

**Recommendation**: Start with **AS9100** if you have aerospace industry connections or proximity to aerospace OEMs (Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, etc.). Choose **ISO 13485** if you have medical device contacts or prefer slightly less complex audit requirements.

**Alternative Strategy**: Pursue **ISO 9001** first (6–12 months), then upgrade to AS9100 or ISO 13485 (adds 6 months). This allows you to serve commercial customers while building certification infrastructure.
