# Daily Bitcoin Market Analysis Log

This directory contains a log of daily Bitcoin market analysis. The goal is to track market movements, key indicators, and evolving scenarios over time to improve forecasting accuracy.

## Methodology

Each day, a new markdown file will be created with the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD_analysis.md`. This file will contain:

1.  **Date:** The date of the analysis.
2.  **Current Price (USD):** The BTC price at the time of analysis.
3.  **Key Observations:** Notes on recent price action, news, or relevant events.
4.  **Scenario Update:** How the current data affects the established price scenarios (from the `btc_scenarios.html` tool).
5.  **Confidence Score:** A score from 1-10 indicating the confidence in the short-term forecast (with 1 being highly uncertain and 10 being highly confident).
6.  **Summary:** A brief summary of the outlook.

This structured data will be used to identify trends and improve the underlying predictive models from the Trading Bot knowledge base.
