MISSION: Provide a reproducible pipeline to (a) simulate the Moveo arm motion in standard ROS 2 environments (MoveIt 2, Gazebo / Ignition, RViz) and (b) execute the validated trajectories on the physical Moveo arm via the trajectory bridge (ROS 2 -> Moonraker/Klipper MANUAL_STEPPER / G-code path).

STATUS (2025-10-01): Single-joint (J1) physical execution achieved THROUGH ROS NODE (trajectory_bridge) -> Moonraker -> Klipper; multi-joint, feedback, and safety layers pending.

PURPOSE OF THIS ONBOARDING FOLDER:
- Fast ramp for any new AI agent or human collaborator.
- Single source of truth for goals, procedures, progress, lessons, and architecture.
- Minimize rediscovery and context scraping time.

HIGH-LEVEL OBJECTIVES (live roadmap):
1. Accurate robot description (URDF/Xacro + SRDF + limits + visuals + collisions).
2. Deterministic MoveIt planning (single joint -> full manipulator).
3. Stable trajectory relay & bridge (DisplayTrajectory/JointTrajectory -> G-code) with limits and safety.
4. Simulation environment parity (RViz visualization; later Gazebo physics; optional Isaac / Ignition).
5. Feedback loop: real joint state acquisition (Klipper -> ROS 2) for validation and future closed-loop control.
6. Extensible multi-joint execution with velocity/accel scaling and payload heuristics.
7. Robust Onboarding artifacts kept current as system evolves.

KEY PRINCIPLES:
- Prefer stable, explicit configuration over magic auto-detection.
- Always verify robot_description consistency across nodes.
- Treat physical motion enablement as an explicit stage (never implicit).
- Log before act: every hardware send must have a preceding acceptance log.

SUCCESS CRITERIA (initial):
- Plan joint1 to a target in MoveIt and observe physical arm reproduce motion.
- Ability to repeat plan with only documented steps + scripts.
- New AI agent can reach same state within <= 30 minutes from clean Ubuntu + instructions here.

NEXT_EXPANSIONS (tracked once baseline solid):
- Add MotionPlanning RViz panel resolution (plugin env fix) & full GUI workflow.
- Multi-joint planning & synchronized trajectory execution.
- Automated feedback publisher for /joint_states from Klipper queries.
- Safety: soft-limit monitoring & emergency stop hook.
- Simulation physics parity (Gazebo) & regression tests.
