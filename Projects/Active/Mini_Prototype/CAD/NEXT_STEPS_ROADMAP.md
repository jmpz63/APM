- [ ] **Assembly sequence diagrams** - show step-by-step construction

**Technical Approach:**
```bash
# Dimension detection via OpenSCAD analysis
openscad --info model.scad | parse_dimensions.py

# Section views using OpenSCAD intersection
intersection() { 
    model(); 
    translate([0,0,-1000]) cube([2000,2000,1000]); 
}
```

### **Professional Drawing Standards**

- [ ] **Material optimization** - nesting layouts for efficient cutting
- [ ] **Cost estimation integration** - automatic BOM pricing from drawings  
- [ ] **Quality inspection planning** - CMM measurement point generation

### **ERP/PLM Integration**
- [ ] **Part numbering automation** - link to company numbering systems
- [ ] **BOM generation** - extract bill of materials from 3D models
- [ ] **Supplier integration** - automatic vendor drawing distribution
- [ ] **Change management** - ECO workflow integration

---

## ü§ñ **Phase 4: AI/Automation (6+ months)**

### **Intelligent Feature Recognition**
- [ ] **Critical dimension identification** - AI determines what to dimension
- [ ] **Manufacturing process recognition** - suggest optimal machining approaches
- [ ] **Design for manufacturability** - automated DFM analysis and suggestions
- [ ] **Standards compliance checking** - AI validation of drawing completeness

### **Advanced Automation**
- [ ] **Natural language drawing generation** - "Create drawing for aluminum bracket"
- [ ] **Parametric drawing templates** - automatically adapt to model changes
- [ ] **Multi-language support** - international drawing standards and languages
- [ ] **AR/VR integration** - 3D model visualization in manufacturing environment
