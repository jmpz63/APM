# APM Knowledge Base - Mission Statement & Management Guide

## 🤖 AI Assistants: Start here
1) Workflow/Operations Guide: Read `_ADMIN/README_AI_WORKFLOW.md` (this is the operations guide). After any knowledge change, call:
    - `from _ADMIN.ai_agent_interface import notify_new_document, ensure_compliance`
    - `notify_new_document("path/to/file.md", "description", "priority")` then `ensure_compliance()`
2) Skim this README (Quick Start below, mission, structure) and `00_MASTER_KNOWLEDGE_INDEX.md`.
3) For Active projects, enforce the Roles pattern: APM is the hub/KB; working files stay in their working folder. Add cross-links both ways.
4) Before you commit, run the compliance helper via `ai_agent_interface.py` (see Quick Start). If you create or edit an Active project hub, include a Roles & Cross-links section (template in `Tools/Templates/PROJECT_HUB_README_TEMPLATE.md`).

## 🚀 Quick Start (Read this first)

What is APM? Your centralized, AI-managed repository for engineering and project knowledge.

Quick navigation
- Main README (this file): start here for overview, workflow, and links
- Engineering/: technical work by discipline
- Knowledge_Base/: learning materials, references
- Projects/: active/completed/archived projects
- Tools/: templates, scripts, utilities
- _ADMIN/: system maintenance and AI workflow docs

For AI assistants (mandatory)
- First action:
```python
from _ADMIN.ai_agent_interface import notify_new_document, ensure_compliance
notify_new_document("path/to/file.md", "description", "priority")
ensure_compliance()  # Learn → Document → Index → Push
```
- Workflow commands:
```bash
python3 _ADMIN/ai_agent_interface.py status     # Check system status
python3 _ADMIN/ai_agent_interface.py integrate  # Auto-integrate changes
bash _ADMIN/workflow.sh                         # Legacy menu (optional)
```

Common tasks
- Find something: read this README, then go to the relevant section
- Add new content: place in the right folder, use a template if available, then notify + ensure_compliance()
- Project management: use Projects/Active/, keep hub READMEs updated with Roles & Cross-links; move to Completed/Archive when done

System health
- Healthy: all major sections have READMEs, Active projects have status, `_ADMIN/todo.md` updated, no orphan files
- Needs attention: missing READMEs, outdated statuses, broken links, growing unorganized files

Emergency procedures
- Disorganized? Use templates in Tools/Templates/, see `_ADMIN/maintenance_log.md`, and create/refresh READMEs
- Handoff fails? Read `_ADMIN/ai_handoff_notes.md`, review `_ADMIN/changelog.md` and `_ADMIN/todo.md`, then update notes

Key principles
1) Workflow compliance via ai_agent_interface is mandatory
2) Documentation-first; if it’s not documented, it doesn’t exist
3) Consistent organization and cross-linking
4) Enable continuity for the next AI/user
5) Optimize for findability and scalable growth

## 📌 Current project status (snapshot — 2025-10-09)

WallPanelization (Active)
- Status: In progress; working repo scaffolded and linked. JSON schema + samples + GhPython exporter and validation tools in place. Bridges catalog created under Software/Bridges in the APM hub. Repo integrated as a submodule in the project hub.
- Working repo: `C:\Users\jmpz6\OneDrive\Moveo\WallPanelization` | Remote: https://github.com/jmpz63/WallPanelization (main)
- Next focus: JSON→ROS 2 bridge node spec/impl; ROS 2→Robot Arm bridge interface; end-to-end smoke test from sample JSON to ROS 2 topic.

moveo_bridge_ws (Active)
- Status: Hub README added with roles/cross-links; pointers to ARM1 live paths; links to TMC KB and WallPanelization.
- Next focus: formalize message contract for JSON→ROS 2; align ROS 2 topics/actions for robot control; minimal demo path planning with MoveIt config.

Klipper_3D_Printer (Active)
- Status: TMC knowledge base enriched (SpreadCycle vs StealthChop, StallGuard basics, TMC5160 tuning cheat sheet). Hub README includes roles & cross-links.
- Next focus: verify live configs on ARM1; capture DUMP_TMC baselines; finalize per-joint current and toff/hstrt/hend tuning; document safety checks.

Mini_Prototype (Active)
- Status: Hub README created with roles; CAD assets and analysis tools documented.
- Next focus: confirm BOM updates and CAD pipeline outputs; keep hub status current.

Housekeeping
- AI workflow consolidated: README is the single Quick Start/Operations guide; `_ADMIN/ai_agent_interface.py` is canonical (helper remains for legacy).
- All Active hubs now include Roles & Cross-links blocks; bidirectional links with working repos are in place.
