### **Start New Projects**
- Use templates in `Tools_and_Resources/Templates/`
- Follow the project structure established
- Document everything in the appropriate section
- Link related projects and knowledge

### **Continue Migration (Next Session)**
- STM32 embedded projects → `Engineering/Electrical/Firmware/`
- Learning materials → `Knowledge_Base/Learning_Materials/`
- Research papers → `Research/Papers/`
- Additional tools and scripts → `Tools_and_Resources/`

## 🎯 **Next AI Assistant Instructions**

When a new AI takes over:

1. **Read these files in order**:
   - `/home/arm1/APM/README.md` (Master document)
   - `/home/arm1/APM/_ADMIN/ai_handoff_notes.md` (Current status)
   - `/home/arm1/APM/_ADMIN/todo.md` (Priority tasks)

2. **Continue the mission**: 
   - Maintain organization standards
   - Keep populating the knowledge base
   - Update documentation regularly
   - Commit changes to git regularly

3. **Current priorities**:
   - Phase 2 migration (STM32 projects)
   - Create quick reference guides
   - Organize learning materials
   - Build out research section
