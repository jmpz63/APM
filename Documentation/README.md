# APM Documentation Organization

## 📁 **Organized Documentation Structure**

This directory contains all documentation files that were previously scattered in the main APM folder, now properly organized for easy discovery and maintenance.

### **📊 System_Status/**
Documentation about the current state and evolution of the APM system:
- `COMPREHENSIVE_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Complete system enhancement overview
- `Phase1_Complete_Summary.md` - First phase completion details
- `Core_Capabilities_Scope.md` - Core system capabilities definition

### **🤖 AI_Guidelines/**  
Guidelines and requirements for AI agents working in the APM system:
- `AI_WORKFLOW_REQUIRED.md` - Mandatory workflow requirements for AI agents

### **🎯 Demos/**
Demonstration files and examples:
- `Business_Intelligence_Demo.md` - Business intelligence capabilities demo

## 🔗 **Cross-References Updated**

All internal links and references have been updated to point to the new organized locations. If you find any broken links, please update them to use the new paths:

```
Old: /APM/AI_WORKFLOW_REQUIRED.md
New: /APM/Documentation/AI_Guidelines/AI_WORKFLOW_REQUIRED.md
```

## 🎯 **Benefits of Organization**

1. **Easier Discovery** - Related documents grouped together
2. **Reduced Clutter** - Main APM folder is cleaner
3. **Better Maintenance** - Clear ownership and purpose for each document
4. **Scalable Structure** - Room for growth within categories
5. **Logical Navigation** - Intuitive folder structure

## 📋 **Maintenance**

This documentation structure is maintained by the APM unified workflow system. When adding new documentation:

1. **System Status docs** → `System_Status/`
2. **AI Guidelines** → `AI_Guidelines/` 
3. **Demos and Examples** → `Demos/`
4. **General Documentation** → Root of this directory
