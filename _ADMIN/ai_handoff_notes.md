### ❗ Critical Information for Next Assistant:

#### 🎯 Primary Objectives:
- Maintain APM as the central knowledge repository
- Follow organizational standards defined in README.md
- Keep documentation current and accessible
- Ensure seamless handoff between AI assistants

#### 📁 Key Locations:
- **Main README**: `/home/arm1/APM/README.md` - READ FIRST
- **Todo List**: `/home/arm1/APM/_ADMIN/todo.md` - Current priorities
- **Changelog**: `/home/arm1/APM/_ADMIN/changelog.md` - Version history
- **Active Projects**: `/home/arm1/APM/Projects/Active/` - Current work

#### 🔧 User's Preferences:
- Prefers comprehensive organization systems
- Values detailed documentation
- Wants AI-managed knowledge base for consistency
- Focuses on engineering projects (mechanical, electrical, civil, CS)
- Works with robotics, 3D printing, embedded systems

#### 🚨 Important Context:
- User has multiple engineering projects across different domains
- Moveo robotic arm project is a key active project
- Klipper/3D printing setup is important
- STM32 embedded development is ongoing
- GitHub repositories exist for some projects (jmpz63)

#### 🛠️ Current Technical Environment:
- Ubuntu Linux system
- VS Code with various extensions
- ROS 2 development environment
- Klipper 3D printer firmware
- STM32 embedded development tools
- Git version control

### 📊 Success Metrics Established:
- Information findability (< 30 seconds for known items)
- Documentation completeness (every project has README)
- System scalability (can add projects without restructuring)
- AI handoff efficiency (new assistant productive in < 5 minutes)

## 🔄 Handoff Protocol for Next Assistant:

1. **Read Main README** (`/home/arm1/APM/README.md`) - Understand mission and structure
2. **Check Todo List** (`/home/arm1/APM/_ADMIN/todo.md`) - See current priorities  
3. **Review Changelog** (`/home/arm1/APM/_ADMIN/changelog.md`) - Understand recent changes
4. **Update This File** - Add your information and update status
5. **Continue Mission** - Maintain and improve the knowledge base

## 📝 Decision Log:

### Organizational Decisions Made:
- Used underscore naming convention for multi-word directories
- Separated active, completed, and archived projects
- Created dedicated admin section for meta-management
- Established documentation-first approach
- Integrated existing Engineering structure rather than recreating

### Technical Decisions Made:
- Markdown format for all documentation
- Git version control recommended for projects
- Flat hierarchy where possible to avoid deep nesting
- Cross-referencing through relative links
- Template-based approach for consistency

## 🎯 Continuation Strategy:

The next AI assistant should focus on:
1. Populating the knowledge base with existing user content
2. Creating templates and automation tools
3. Establishing regular maintenance routines
4. Improving discoverability and organization
5. Building out project documentation
